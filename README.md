# Student-Face-Identification-And-Guardian-System
Project Name: Integrity-Driven Facial Recognition Guardian 
Purpose: Ensure secure and responsible use of facial recognition in educational settings. Technology: Deep learning models for accurate facial identification. 
This project aims to make it easy for students to complain using a website. We'll use facial recognition to make sure only students can complain.
We'll focus on making the website easy to use and keeping student information safe.
We'll also listen to feedback to improve the system. 
Overall, our goal is to create a simple and secure way for students to raise concerns.
